Requirements
============

THOR runs in any Windows, Linux and macOS environment without any
further requirements. Everything needed is already included in the
program package.

For best results, it is necessary to run THOR with administrative
privileges or LOCAL\_SYSTEM on Windows and “root” on Linux/macOS
systems.
